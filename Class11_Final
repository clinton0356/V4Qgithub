The vending machince is not functioning after putting in money for a snack. 
The operator put in one dollar to get a snack and press F5 for a bag of cheetoes. 
The dollar was inserted and the lever for F5 did not move or turn. 
The machince didn't release the snack to the customer.
So the operator had to turn off the machine and turn it back on to cycle through the functions.
Once the machine was fully functionally the snack dispensed from the vending machine.
